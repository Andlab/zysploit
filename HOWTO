To build:

Step 1: 'android update project -p .'
Step 2: ant debug && adb install -r bin/zysploit-debug.apk
Step 3: adb shell am startservice -a com.unrevoked.Zysploit.Zysploit

(step 3 may change on devices that only have broadcast support)

The helper is not built as part of the ant build process; make -C helper to
rebuild it.
